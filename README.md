# OpenCV_Examples
##About 
OpenCV is an open source platform for image processing. It provides 1000's of algorithms for video and image processing. If you want to :
* Process a video
* Process frames of video
* Perform operations such as scale, rotation or translation of frames
* Perform morphological operations
* Process video or images on Android
and so many..

##Now some history
It began with v1.0.0 in 2006 and over the period gradually grew, with many opencv source contributions and GSOC contributions. The latest version is 3.1 which is stable with more than 2500 optimized algorithms.

##Basics 
If you are a beginner and want to learn OpenCV. Then this is the right page. I will gradually upload examples to help you. If you want to learn more then you can always refer [here](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html) opencv _official_ tutorial page. 

##Why this repository?
The repository provides an overview on some functionalities and algorithms OpenCV provides. This will help OpenCV users 
to learn more "what opencv offers?".

##First examples uploaded
###Open a image and video using opencv
This is very easy, in contrast to opening an image or video digitally for some transformation or processing using only some high level programming language.
 
Refer example : OpenVideo.cpp
Refer example : OpenImage.cpp
